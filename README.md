## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Client really liked the idea of a clean, minimal website with the use case of shopping her book to publishers.  To this end, I built a custom one page design with some slick css animations and lots of white space.


## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Add onepage.js for better scrolling interface.

## Lessons Learned:

Oh, that's why we use frameworks!  Always fun testing infinite device sizes with a custom design!  100vh for the win
