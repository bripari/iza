				<h2><i>Ania</i> - Excerpt</h2>
				<h4>The unexpected death of a creative writing teacher and mentor</h4>
				<p>If someone types your name into a search engine, images of you come up. You’re in a clear plastic mask with bright pink lips and eyeshadow, or you’re wearing a severe Dostoevsky-like bushy beard. Of course, your work is listed, that broken and repetitive poetry that always sounded better when you performed it. I can still hear your voice. Formal, almost strained, with a faint Polish twist. There’s an announcement of your death in the paper, and I see comments from students I studied with and teachers who briefly taught me. Their sentiments appear polite, almost constrained. Where is the rest of their grief hidden? Are they disturbed? When the Polish grieve, it’s obscure and loud, close to death itself. I remember seeing Tata on his knees in the living room as I walked downstairs. He got the call that his mama, my babcia, had died in Poland. The distance from Australia, a nearly twenty-hour flight, meant he wasn’t there to see her or say goodbye. His cry became a scream. I waited for his lungs to fall out of his mouth, for his being to cease.</p>

				<h2><i>Family Tradition</i> - Excerpt</h2>
				<h4>Separated from her immediate family when the pandemic hits New York, Iza reflects on her mother's survival lessons from Chornobyl as a way to feel closer to home.</h4>
				<p>By the time I reached the grocery store in Harlem, people had stripped the shelves of canned foods, bread, flour, pasta, and toilet paper. I squeezed through crowds and shopping trolleys to get what I could. Down one narrow and crowded aisle, I witnessed a middle-aged woman climbing shelves and shoulders to reach a single box of tissues on the top shelf. The scene had a hellish Hieronymus Bosch painting feel; the chaos and flailing limbs, the interwoven bodies spread out in a sea of desperation. And still, despite the strangeness, the moment was digestible. I normalized it in my mind. These ventures had added a much-needed rhythm to my silent days. A woman competitively climbing for the last box of tissues wasn’t going to change that.
